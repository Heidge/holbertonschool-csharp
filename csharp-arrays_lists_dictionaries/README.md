## C# Tasks

### 0. Print an array of integers

Write a method that creates and prints an array of integers of a given size.

Class Name: Array
Prototype: public static int[] CreatePrint(int size)
Returns the new array
The integers in the array should start with 0 and increment by one until the given size is met (see output below)
If size is 0, print a blank line
If size is less than 0, print Size cannot be negative and return null

### 1. Access an element in an array
### 2. Replace element
### 3. Print an array of integers... in reverse!
